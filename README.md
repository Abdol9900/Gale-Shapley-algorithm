1 Generating Male and female number of lists.
To run the code Generating-men_list.py, one needs python 3.6 installed, along with the packages, the code generated a number of lists for the male. As well as to run the code Generating-women list is exactly the same as running the code to generate the men list. In addition, second needs are creating two text files one named men_list.txt and another one named women_list.txt First ensure the following packages are installed and imported.
Listing 1: Generating-men_list.py - Import Statements import random import json
Listing 2: Generating-men_list.py- Generating number for male and saved in text file data = {} dictionaryKeyLength = 50 arrayListLength = 50
def shuffleArray(length): baseList = [] for index in range(length): baseList.append(str(index + 1))
random.shuffle(baseList) return baseList
for index in range(dictionaryKeyLength): data[str(index + 1)] = shuffleArray(arrayListLength)
with open('./men_list.txt' , 'w') as f: f.write(json.dumps(data)) # saved numbers in men_list.txt
Listing 2: Generating-men_list.py- Generating number for female and saved in text file data = {} dictionaryKeyLength = 50 arrayListLength = 50
def shuffleArray(length): baseList = [] for index in range(length): baseList.append(str(index + 1))
random.shuffle(baseList)
return baseList
for index in range(dictionaryKeyLength): data[str(index + 1)] = shuffleArray(arrayListLength)
with open('./women_list.txt' , 'w') as f: f.write(json.dumps(data)) # saved numbers in women_list.txt
2 Gale shapely algorithm
3 1. In the loop in the first round
4 a. every single man proposes to the most preferred woman.
5 b. the answer of every woman to the man she prefers most is "maybe" while "no" to the rest of people. As such, the woman becomes temporarily "engaged" to the most preferred man, and equally, that man is temporarily engaged to her.
6 2. In every succeeding round
7 a. every single man proposes to the most-liked woman to whom he has not yet proposed even if the woman is engaged.
8 b. if the woman is not presently engaged or likes the guy over her current temporary man, she replies "maybe". Hence, she rejects her present temporary partner who becomes single.
9 This process continues until everybody is engaged.
10 To run the code G-shapely.py one needs to ensure that python packages are installed and imported in order to run this code.

3 The cost functions
Once every male and female present in the list are paired up, we create a list of men proposed to women and sum up the cost function. Finding out the cost works as follows: To find the cost function and we numbered the male preference list and the female preference list, In the male shortlist, we find out the position of female and likewise find out the position and then we calculated the total cost for male and female.

cost_list = cost_i + cost_j total_cost = sum(cost_list)
return total_cost
4 Shortlists
We followed two central implications of this initial proposal sequence to create a shortlist:
- If m recommends w, then there exists no stability in matching and it happens that m has a superior spouse than w.
- If w is proposed to by m, then there exists instability in matching where w has a poorer spouse than m.
From the above fundamentals, we can eliminate m from wâ€™s list and w from mâ€™s list if w gets an offer from someone she prefers to m. We apply this rule in a loop and the resulting list is called a shortlist.
Listing 1: G-shapely.py-creating a shortlist for male and female
def shortlist_women(women_cp, tmp): """ Creates shortlists for women preference list.

5 Rotation
The significance of rotation lies in the fact that if in the male optimal solution, each mi exchanges his partner wi for wi+1 (i + 1 mod n) then the resulting matching is also stable. The same can be stated for a female optimal solution. Once a rotation has been identified, we eliminated it. We do this in a loop so that one or more, so the rotations may be exposed in the resulting further reduced lists. Repeating this over a loop and pairing each man with the first woman in his reduced list yields a stable matching.
Listing 1: G-shapely.py- finding the collection of rotation. # auxiliary variables for finding rotations rotations = [] last_rotation_for_man = {} weight_of_rotation = {} level_of_rotation = {} level = 0 ordered_mw_copy = ordered_mw.copy()

# Loop that goes throught the levels of rotations until it doesn't # find any more rotations while True: # Go through the unvisited nodes and find cycles exposed_rotations = [] visited = set() for k in ordered_mw.keys(): if not k in visited: current = k rotation = [] while current not in visited: visited.add(current) # A man with only one woman in his shortlist was found # Hence we won't be able to find any rotation in this path if len(ordered_mw[current]) < 2:
rotation.clear() break # add a tuple with (man, current partner, next partner) rotation.append((current, ordered_mw[current][0], ordered_mw[current][1])) # move to next man current = sw[ ordered_mw[current][1] ][-1]
while len(rotation) > 0 and rotation[0][0] != current: rotation.pop(0)
# add to list of rotations if a rotation was found if len(rotation) > 0: exposed_rotations.append(rotation)
# there aren't any more rotations if len(exposed_rotations) == 0: break
Listing 2: G-shapely.py- Loop that eliminates the rotations and calculates the weight of rotation # Loop that eliminates the rotations and calculates the weight of # each rotation for rotation in exposed_rotations: rotations.append(rotation) current_rotation = len(rotations) level_of_rotation[current_rotation] = level weight = 0
G.add_node(current_rotation) labels[current_rotation] = 'p{}'.format(current_rotation)
for man, woman, new_woman in rotation: weight += men_cp[man].index(woman) - men_cp[man].index(new_woman) weight += women_cp[woman].index(man) weight -= women_cp[new_woman].index(man)
if man in last_rotation_for_man: predecessor = last_rotation_for_man[man] G.add_edge(predecessor, current_rotation)
last_rotation_for_man[man] = current_rotation
if ordered_mw[man][0] == woman: ordered_mw[man].pop(0)
sw[new_woman].pop(-1) while sw[new_woman][-1] != man: x = sw[new_woman][-1] sw[new_woman].pop(-1) # TODO: check if new_woman in ordered_mw[x]: ordered_mw[x].remove(new_woman)
weight_of_rotation[current_rotation] = str(weight)
level += 1

# store list of edges in the graph before starting to delete some of them graph_edges = list(G.edges())
# Loop to delete unnecessary edges in the graph # we try to remove edges to see if removing them disconnects the nodes # that they're connecting for e in graph_edges: G.remove_edge(e[0], e[1])
if not nx.has_path(G, e[0], e[1]): G.add_edge(e[0], e[1])

7 Finding the maximum weight closed subset of Pâ€™
After creating the directed graph, we added the negative node to source s and the positive node to sink t and then we applied the minimum cut by removing some rotation Pâ€™ in order to find the male optimal list.
Listing 1: G-shapely.py â€“ adding the source and the sink to the graph
# Create flow graph where we will compute the minimum cut G_cut = nx.DiGraph() G_cut.add_node('s') G_cut.add_node('t') G_cut.add_nodes_from(G.nodes) G_cut.add_edges_from(G.edges)
for rotation in G.nodes: weight = int(weight_of_rotation[rotation])
if weight < 0: G_cut.add_edge('s', rotation, capacity=-weight) elif weight > 0: G_cut.add_edge(rotation, 't', capacity=weight)
removed_rotations = nx.minimum_cut(G_cut, 's', 't')[1][1] removed_rotations.remove('t') removed_rotations = list(removed_rotations)
print("Removed rotations:") print(removed_rotations)
Listing 2: G-shapely.py- sum up the maximum weight.
new_cost = male_optimal_cost
for rotation in removed_rotations: new_cost -= int(weight_of_rotation[rotation])
print("New cost: {}".format(new_cost))
If we select 2 from the two options above so the female will propose to male, as we wanted to find the male optimality we write this function for evaluating and testing the code to see how correct it is.
Listing 1: G-shapely.py-female propose to male.
elif x == 2: __initWomen__() stable_matching_women() matched_pairs = strip_m(tmp) matched_pairs.sort(key = lambda x: x[0]) print('Following are the stable pairs:') pp.pprint(matched_pairs) print("Total Cost calculated: {}".format(calc_cost(tmp)))
print("Women shortlist:") pp.pprint(shortlist_women(women_cp, tmp))
sw = shortlist_women(women_cp, tmp)
print("Men shortlist:") mw = shortlist_men(men_cp, sw, tmp) _mw = dict(mw)
cv = {} for k, v in sorted(_mw.items()): cv[k] = v
da = cv db = men_cp pp.pprint(reorder(da , db))
